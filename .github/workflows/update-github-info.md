# Update Mona's GitHub Info website

Read `notes/mona-notes.md` before making changes.

Use these sources:
- `notes/mona-notes.md`
- GitHub Blog: https://github.blog/latest/
- GitHub Changelog: https://github.blog/changelog/
- Awesome Copilot workflows: https://awesome-copilot.github.com/workflows/

Update `site/content/github-info.md` with concise, practical GitHub updates for readers.
Include a `## Latest GitHub Updates` section when relevant.

Use the `edit` tool to modify `site/content/github-info.md` safely.
Do not write directly to `main`; rely on `safe-outputs` with `create-pull-request`.
Open a pull request for Mona to review and include source context from GitHub Blog, GitHub Changelog, or Awesome Copilot workflows.
